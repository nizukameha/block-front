# Blog

This project was developed during my studies at [Simplon](https://simplon.co/formation/developpeur-web-et-web-mobile/11). The blog was created using React and Next.js for the frontend, and Symfony for the backend.

## Features

The homepage displays various articles. There is no user management, allowing everyone to add/remove/edit an article and post/delete comments. Each article has a view counter, and there is a search bar.
